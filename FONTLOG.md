FONTLOG for the Ross font
==========================

This file provides detailed information on the Ross font software. This information should be
distributed along with the Ross fonts and any derivative works.


Basic font information
----------------------

Ross is a typeface designed by Abraham Lee to resemble the notation style found in the book
"The Art of Music Engraving and Processing" by Ted Ross. This font software is not designed for
use in a word-processing application, although all the glyphs may be accessed at their
respective Unicode points. It was originally designed for use with LilyPond, the automatic
music engraver.
